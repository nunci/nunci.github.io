We all have long-term language goals. Maybe you want to be fluent by the time of your big international trip, be able to have a casual conversation with a stranger, or be able to listen to a TV show in your next language. These goals help remind us why we started to learn a language in the first place. But they are large and difficult to manage as a whole. Setting a goal for the month, week, or even day can help you break the huge task of language learning down into bite-sized pieces.

### Which goals should you set?

When thinking about goals to set, you should think about two things: *studying* and *practicing*. Studying is learning new material or reviewing old material in a classroom environment. Practicing is using what you've learned while studying in a real-world environment.

For practicing, you could perhaps aim to find a language exchange partner, hold a conversation about your favorite hobby, or write a letter in your target language. The most important thing is that you find goals that you can realistically accomplish in a day, week, or a month at most.

For studying, you should lean more towards statistics rather than the abstract or personal. You could aim to [capture](https://nunci.app/2021/06/27/what-does-capturing-your-language-mean.html) and learn 10 new words a day, study for 20 minutes every day, or review a little bit everyday by knocking out your [flashcard deck](https://nunci.app/2021/07/01/generating-intelligent-language-flashcards-with-nunci.html) in nunci. When it comes to language learning, you should study most effectively by doing all three.

Practicing goals are personal, which is why we will only discuss studying goals here.

### Setting your study goals

The most important thing to keep in mind when setting a goal is to make your goal realistic. Everyone has different time commitments and schedules. However, anyone can set the following three goals:

* review your old material every day
* capture and learn new material every day
* study for the same (small) amount of time every day

If you are busy, perhaps you can only capture a couple new notes, study for 5 or 10 minutes, and review only part of your [flashcard deck](https://nunci.app/2021/07/01/generating-intelligent-language-flashcards-with-nunci.html). If you have more time, aim for 10 or 20 notes, 25 or 30 minutes, and all of your flashcard deck each day.

Using [nunci](https://nunci.app), you can set these goals easily. Head over to the settings (‚öôÔ∏è) tab, and check out the settings under `Study` and `Browsing` to set them.

The goals you choose to set are up to you. But the important thing is that you aim to study a little every day, instead of all at once at the end of the week.

### Reaching your study goals

With [nunci](https://nunci.app), tracking and reaching your statistical study goals every day is easy. nunci lets you effortlessly track how many new notes (words, phrases, grammar, etc.) that you add each day, as well as the time and number of flashcards you've studied. You can also aim to hit your highest daily streak by reaching your daily goals every single day. This helps keep you honest about your study habits, letting you improve over time.

When nunci [generates](https://nunci.app/2021/07/01/generating-intelligent-language-flashcards-with-nunci.html) and [schedules](https://nunci.app/2021/06/23/what-is-spaced-repetition.html) flashcards based on the notes you create, you will see all the material that you need to review or are currently learning, with new material mixed in. When using nunci, the goal is to finish all of your currently due flashcards by getting down to a zero count. By doing this, you know that you have completed your goals, for the moment.

Tip: Check the icon badge count or study screen later, you might have more flashcards due later in the day:
