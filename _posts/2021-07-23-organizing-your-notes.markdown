## Effectively Organize Your (Seemingly Countless) Language Notes

The act of creating notes intrinsically helps you remember your next language. So it's only natural that you should want to [capture](https://nunci.app/2021/06/27/what-does-capturing-your-language-mean.html) as many lexical tidbits as possible throughout your day. Intermediate or advanced language learners can take upwards of thousands of notes, attempting to [memorize](https://nunci.app/2021/06/23/what-is-spaced-repetition.html) them along the way. How is this possible? How do you best organize, label, or categorize your notes so that you can study and practice your language most effectively?

### There Is No One-Size-Fits-All Approach

Everyone organizes differently, so it is best to find a method or tool that fits your personal style and needs. In-class students differ from self-study learners just as much as languages differ from each other. Find the method that works best for your style and language. Some people prefer good old-fashioned pen and paper whereas some prefer utilizing software to help them organize and study more efficiently.

### Categorizing Your Notes

When you create notes with [nunci](https://nunci.app/), you can label or tag them with different categories such as parts of speech, situations like your daily routine or work, a personal time in your life, or anything you choose. It's important to categorize notes with objective parts of speech as well as personal topics like your daily routine or favorite hobbies.

### Finding Your Notes

You can easily go back and find notes you created based on these tags, text, dates, your pronunciation accuracy, and more.
