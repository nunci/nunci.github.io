**Why does nunci cost money monthly?**

In order to help you practice your pronunciation in the best possible way, nunci uses paid services for translation, high-quality speaking, and listening to your pronunciations. Additional monthly costs are required to make certain that your data is safe and secure on our servers. The minimal profit that nunci makes is reallocated towards ongoing engineering, research, design, and product costs.
